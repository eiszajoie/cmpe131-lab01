Branching allows a parallel line of development. It creates a new line, copying the original line, so one can make edits on the file without changing the original. When the changes are sufficient and complete, one can merge this branch to the original line, applying the changes. This is powerful because it ensures the safety of the original file. It allows the developer to fix bugs, add features, and do experiments without affecting the main code.This prevents accidental deletion of codes or adding errors into the main code. It can also allow for different solutions to be tested before choosing the best one.
